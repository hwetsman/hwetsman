### Hi there ğŸ‘‹

ğŸ§  I'm actually a retired addiction psychiatrist who is retraining in data science.

ğŸ‘¶ I still have a lot of working years ahead of me and am open to helping cool people build something great.

ğŸ©º When I built my addiction treatment company, I found a better way to treat addiciton. I'd love to turn that into an app to make treatment
affordable and easy. If you want to take the $6B/yr addiction treatment industry, I'll tell you how. But until then, I'm going to focus on ds.

ğŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on a variety of projects of personal interest.

ğŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning Introduction to Machine Learning at Udacity.
