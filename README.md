### Hi there ğŸ‘‹

ğŸ§  I'm actually a retired addiction psychiatrist who is retraining in data science.

ğŸ‘¶ I still have a lot of working years ahead of me and am open to helping cool people build something great.

ğŸ©º When I built my addiction treatment company, I had found a better way to treat addiciton. The people who 
bought the company, put the system in a drawer. If you want to take the $6B/yr addiction treatment 
industry, I'll show you how. No, I won't treat patients or operate your business, but if you want to 
learn how to take the industry, I'm your guy. But until anyone calls, I'm going to focus on my new field.

ğŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on a variety of projects of personal interest.

ğŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning Introduction to Machine Learning at Udacity.
